# Exploratory Data Analysis (Course Project 1)

This is a repo with files for EDA course project 1. The repo contains:

1. R script downloading the data and making the plots (make_plots.R)
2. code book describing the data and any transformations performed to make the plots (CodeBook.Rmd)
3. Four plots (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png)
4. README file explaining how all of the scripts work (README.md)

All the analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) and RStudio version 1.2.5033.

In make_plots.R script we first download the dataset, load the data and convert date and time variables to Date and Time classes in R. Then, we read the data and make plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.
